## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

Kiara Sunil Singh - I found this assignment to be very challenging especially since this was the first time I've ever had to code with trees. I found the most difficult part to be reading and writing since it used different logic than the rest of the assignment and troubleshooting all the loops and iterations was difficult. I felt that the instructions were unclear and it was especially hard to understand what the read method was supposed to do. Nonetheless, I was able to learn more about trees and how they worked.

Chiashi Yang - This assignment was very challenging for me. Because we had never worked with trees before, I struggled with writing some of the code. Unlike the other assignments where we worked with somewhat familiar data structures such as arrays, hash tables, and lists, this concept was entirely new. I found the pathways to be interesting and the way that we coded the binary search trees were a little similar to linkedlists. I do wish the instructions were a little more clear that way the assignment would have gone more smoothly.
