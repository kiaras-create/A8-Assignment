## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
Kiara Sunil Singh - I found this assignment to be very challenging especially since this was the firs time I've ever had to code with trees. I found the most difficult part to be reading and writing since I it used different logic than the rest of the assignment and troubleshooting all the loops and iterations was difficult. I felt that the instructions were unclear and it was especially hard to understand what the read method was supposed to do. Nonetheless, I was able to learn more about trees and how they worked.
