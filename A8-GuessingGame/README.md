## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
Shakila Jafari- I found this assignment challenging in a different way because we were working with concepts and tools that were new to us. I’m hoping that working on these now will make the next assignments easier, especially since we’re finally getting a sense of how trees work and how to actually use them. Even with that, it wasn’t always easy to understand what each task was asking for or how to implement them.
I was also confused at first about using try/catch block. It felt unfamiliar, but after looking it up and experimenting with it, I understood it much better. Overall, it helped me get more comfortable with these new concepts.
