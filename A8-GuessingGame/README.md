## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

Kiara Sunil Singh - I found this assignment to be very challenging especially since this was the first time I've ever had to code with trees. I found the most difficult part to be reading and writing since it used different logic than the rest of the assignment and troubleshooting all the loops and iterations was difficult. I felt that the instructions were unclear and it was especially hard to understand what the read method was supposed to do. Nonetheless, I was able to learn more about trees and how they worked.

Chiashi Yang - This assignment was very challenging for me. Because we had never worked with trees before, I struggled with writing some of the code. Unlike the other assignments where we worked with somewhat familiar data structures such as arrays, hash tables, and lists, this concept was entirely new. I found the pathways to be interesting and the way that we coded the binary search trees were a little similar to linkedlists. I do wish the instructions were a little more clear that way the assignment would have gone more smoothly.

Shakila Jafari- I found this assignment challenging in a different way because we were working with concepts and tools that were new to us. I’m hoping that working on these now will make the next assignments easier, especially since we’re finally getting a sense of how trees work and how to actually use them. Even with that, it wasn’t always easy to understand what each task was asking for or how to implement them.
I was also confused at first about using try/catch block. It felt unfamiliar, but after looking it up and experimenting with it, I understood it much better. Overall, it helped me get more comfortable with these new concepts.

Victoria Reyes Borges - I found this assignment to be challenging at first due to the confusing logic of trees. I was unsure how to implement them exactly and how to track/navigate them. However, I was able to figure it out and help my friends as well. I wish the intructions would've been more specific and detailed, since them being vague caused me and my classmates to not really understand what we had to do. I hope we get to work with trees again sisnce their logic is weird, but fun.
